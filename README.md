# WIP

A social network for buying and selling car parts as a project in the course "Advanced Topics in Distributed and Reactive Programming".

I have used the [MERN-boilerplate](https://github.com/arkon/MERN-boilerplate) project as a basis.
This is a project using the following technologies:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for the frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) for the backend
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styles (using the SCSS syntax)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compilation


## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 6+

```shell
npm install
```


## Running

Production mode:

```shell
npm start
```

Development (Webpack dev server) mode:

```shell
npm run start:dev
```
